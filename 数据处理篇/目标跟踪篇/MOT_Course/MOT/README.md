Implementation of the following algorithms:
- [x] Nearest Neighbors Filter (NN)
- [x] Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDA)
- [x] Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF)

The main class is located at [HA01/singleobjectracker.m](./HA01/singleobjectracker.m)

Simulations can be done using either [HA01/main.m](./HA01/main.m) or [HA01/simulation.m](./HA01/simulation.m)

## Home-Assignment 02 (HA02) - Tracking n Objects in Clutter
Implementation of the following algorithms:
- [x] Global Nearest Neighbors Filter (GNN)
- [x] Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDA)
- [x] Track-oriented Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (TO-MHT)

The main class is located at [HA02/n_objectracker.m](./HA02/n_objectracker.m)

Simulations can be done using either [HA02/main.m](./HA02/main.m) or [HA02/simulation.m](./HA02/simulation.m)
